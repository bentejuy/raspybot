0.1.3
-----

- Removed unnecessary directory
- Removed unused code
- Deleting compressed files
- Updated and added some test files
- Update InterfaceGPIO
- Allows objects check and filter by interface type
- Rewritten InterfaceManager to manage more kinds of Interfaces


0.1.2
-----

- Update test files
- Added function to modified the correction factor
